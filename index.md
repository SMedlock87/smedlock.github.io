# PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT

My coursework here at SNHU has given me the skills and understanding of computer science as well as software engineering. I have learned a lot through this course and plan to use every single aspect of what I have learned throughout the course in the future. Based on the topics below, I have been introduced and been using these skills and techniques throughout my entire enrollment here at SNHU. For the last 10 years or so, I have been wanting to become a Software Engineer and now with only a few weeks left, it feels so surreal. I'm excited for the future and ready to learn even more. I have showcased my skills and strengths by applying what I have learned to complete the final project for the CS 499 Capstone Course. The final project is a basic pet class or as I like to call it, now, a pet check in application which will be explained later in the assessment. This assessment will touch on the topics of collaboration, communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. Other topics covered in the assessment is my project and the narratives as well as my initial code review.

### COLLABORATING IN A TEAM ENVIRONMENT

Collaborating in a team environment has helped showcased my strengths and shape my professional goals and values and prepared me to either enter or become more employable in the computer science field by allowing me to understand the computer science field and working with peers. In the CS-310 course, I learned how to communicate properly with my peers. Some important skills I learned while working in a team environment were version control, history, configuration and cloning of repositories, pushing local repositories to remote shared repositories, branching and merging, states of source files, and code reviews. Code reviews in a team environment are extremely important. This sets the tone for how the program will be further developed and helps identify bugs and solve security issues. Code reviews are designed to help the team to create a plan and to assist in decision making processes. Code reviews should detail important in-line comments for each element of the projects structure which is also a best practice collaborative environment as well as individually. Code reviews also aid in the support of stakeholders by understanding and fulfilling the needs of the stakeholders. Another best practice includes committing changes sooner rather than later. 

### COMMUNICATING TO STAKEHOLDERS

Communicating to stakeholders are critical in keeping up with the design ideas, time frames, and making sure the staff is going in the right direction with the project. Code reviews also same time and money. Daily meetings and communication with peers through email and phone are other ways in communicating to stakeholders. With constant contact with the stakeholders, this ensures the project specifications can be discussed in detail or for any last minute’s changes made by the stakeholders can be handled as well. In an agile environment, the master is responsible for communicating to stakeholders by sprints, backlog requirements, user stories and communication devices and applications.

### DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

I learned about data structures and algorithms in the CS 260 course. This course was designed to help aid in problem solving using algorithmic functions to solve complex problems. This was the direct introduction to data structures and algorithms. I was taught how to again work as a team in a team environment as well as communication with the stakeholders. This course was also an introduction to testing, documentation, and security. 

### SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DATABASE

Software engineering and databases were introduced early in DAD 220 that included databases and data mining. I learned how to use SQL to create, update, read, and delete information within a database. I learned how to join tables and write queries to retrieve data from the databases. I learned data management and analysis as well.

### SECURITY

As for security, I have learned a lot. The class that taught me the most would have to be CS 405. This class went into details of security such as DevSecOps, verifying and validation, defense in depth, threat matrix, triple A policies, and encryption. This class taught me how to incorporate standards and principles. Some of them included sql injections, exceptions, validating input, keeping it simple, and many more.

# SUMMARY
The pet class now referred to as Pet Check In uses basically everything I have learned throughout my journey here at SNHU. This project covers each topic listed above using the skills I have learned thus far. I transformed this pet class into a working, interactive program to check in, add, update, delete, and search for a pet in a database. I even added a log in screen for users and a way for new users to create an account to access the application to perform crud operations. I used one course and assignment for the entire project and just improved it overall based on the narratives listed below. For future enhancements and ideas would be to incorporate a better way to hash passwords to keep important information safe. I stuck with the basics for this application to allow myself enough time to complete the project on time. 

# NARRATIVES

### SOFTTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING

The artifact is a pet check in application that allows a user to check in a pet for grooming services. It was created in the IT 145 course. It was a basic program that got input from the user to check in a pet but it wasn't complete. It was a starting point and I wanted to showcase my skills by using this class to improve it throughout the CS 499 Capstone Course. The skills that I learned and incorporated into this now functioning application includes initialize variables, keeping the code simple, using annotations/in line comments, and understanding the design of the initial program. I learned how to incorporate prepared statements. I have used them in the past, but I didn’t have a clear understanding, but I do know that it provides security for the application. I used pseudocode to guide the initial plan mentioned in the code review. I put myself on a strict time schedule and each week continued to make progress on the overall functionality and design of the application. I really didn't have a lot of issues with the software design and engineering sector.

### ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES

I used the same artifact for the entire project which is the pet class that was created in the IT 145 course. I selected this item because I feel like it can show my skills and what I could make out of the simple pet class that used simple setter and getter methods. I wanted to bring this application to life to be intuitive and interactive. I incorporated searching to find animals in a database. I did do a little of array to strings with the password input from the user. The artifact now can check to see if a username and password is in the database or not, login, add a new user, and will display a menu after ensuring username and password are correct. The issues I ran across were using the right methods to call to obtain the pet information based on the search criteria. I finally realized that I was trying to call from another method inappropriately and which caused errors in the program as well as crashes.

### DATABASES

Again, I used the pet class from IT 145 course to display my skills using databases. I selected this item because I feel like it can show my skills and what I could make out of the simple pet class that used simple setter and getter methods. I feel like I have been working on the database section the entire time as it includes one database and three tables for user information and pet/check in information. This section of the assignment details ways that I used SQL statements as well as prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks. I also incorporated being able to connect to a database using a username and password within the application. Honestly, with this course, I feel like I have learned a lot working with Java. I can admit that starting this program that I thought java was the hardest language to learn but it has turned out to not be so bad after all. I learned that I could use a j formatted text field for the date input. Learning about CRUD operations before this course has really been helpful as well because I’m currently using these operations to update/insert/add users/pets to the database. Throughout the project I addressed input validation, initializing variables, and coding standards and principles to ensure the program is secure. Problems I have run into is trying to understand how to populate my table (created table) based on search results and how to look up a pet based on the id number. I overcame these challenges by changing the way the SQL queries were written.


# CODE REVIEW

This code review explains the details of the initial plan for the final project of the pet class. It explains how I completed the project, and it also includes the existing functionality, code analysis and planned enhancements.
