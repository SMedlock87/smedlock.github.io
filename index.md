# PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT

My coursework here at SNHU has given me the skills and understanding of computer science as well as software engineering. I have learned a lot through this course and plan to use every single aspect of what I have learned throughout the course in the future. Based on the topics below, I have been introduced and been using these skills and techniques throughout my entire enrollment here at SNHU. For the last 10 years or so, I have been wanting to become a Software Engineer and now with only a few week left, it feels so surreal. I'm excited for the future and ready to learn even more. I have showcased my skills and strengths by applying what I have learned to complete the final project for the CS 499 Capstone Course. The final project is a basic pet class or as I like to call it, now, a pet check in application which will be explained later in the assessmemt. This assessment will touch on the topics of collaboration, communication, data structures and algorithms, software engineering, databases and security. Other topics covered in the assessement is my project and the narratives as well as my initial code review. 

### COLLABORATING IN A TEAM ENVIRONMENT

Collaborating in a team environment has helped showcased my strengths and shape my professional goals and values and prepared me to either enter or become more employable in the computer science field by allowing me to understand the computer science field and working with peers. In the CS-310 course, I learned how to communicate properly with my peers. Some important skills I learned while working in a team environment were version control, history, configuration and cloning of repositories, pushing local repositories to remote shared repositories, branching and merging, states of source files, and code reviews. Code reviews in a team environment are extremely important. This sets the tone for how the progam will be further developed and helps identify bugs and solve security issues. Code reviews are designed to help the team to create a plan and to assist in decision making processes. Code reviews should detail important in-line comments for each element of the projects strucutre which is also a best practice collaborative environments as well as individually. Code reviews also aid in the support of stakeholders by understanding and fulfuilling the needs of the stakeholders. Another best practice include commiting changes sooner rather than later. 

### COMMUNICATING TO STAKEHOLDERS

Communicating to stakeholders are critical in keeping up with the design ideas, time frames, and making sure the staff is going in the right direction with the project. Code reviews also same time and money. Daily meetings and communication with peers through email and phone are others ways in communicating to stakeholders. With constant contact with the stakeholders, this ensures the project specifications can be discussed in detail or for any last minutes changes made by the stakeholders can be handled as well. In an agile environment, the master is responsible for communicating to stakeholders by sprints, backlog requirements, user stories and communication devices and applications.

### DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

I learned about data structures and algorithms in the CS 260 course. This course was designed to to help aid in problem solving using algorithmic functions to solve complex problems. This was the direct introduction to data structures and algorithms. I was taught how to again work as a team in a team environment as well as communication with the stakeholders. This course was also an introduction to testing, documentation and security. 

### SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND DATABASE

Software engineering and databases were introduced early in DAD 220 that included databases and data mining. I learned how to use SQL to create, update, read, and delete information within a database. I learned how to join tables and write queries to retrieve data from the databases. I learned data management and analysis as well.

### SECURITY

As for security, I have learned a lot. The class that taught me the most would have to be CS 405. This class went into details of security such as DevSecOps,
verifying and validation, defense in depth, threat matrix, triple A polciies, and encryption. This class taught me how to incorporate standards and principles. Some of them included sql injections, exceptions, vaidating input, keeping it simple, and many more. 

# SUMMARY
The pet class now referred to as Pet Check In uses basically everything I have learned throughtout my journey here at SNHU. As a whole, this project covers each topic listed above using the skills I have learned thus far. I transformed this pet class into a working, interactive program to check in, add, update, delete, and search for a pet in a database. I even added a log in screen for users and a way for new users to create an account to access the application to perform crud operations. 

# NARRATIVES


# CODE REVIEW

This code review explains the details of the initial plan for the final project of the pet class. It explains how I completed the project, and it also includes the existing functionality, code analysis and planned enhancements.
