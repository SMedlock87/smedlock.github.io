# PROFESSIONAL ASSESSEMENT

### COLLABORATING IN A TEAM ENVIRONMENT

Collaborating in a team environment has helped showcased my strengths and shape my professional goals and values and prepared me to either enter or become more employable in the computer science field by allowing me to understand the computer science field and working with peers. In the CS-310 course, I learned how to communicate properly with my peers. Some important skills I learned while working in a team environment were version control, history, configuration and cloning of repositories, pushing local repositories to remote shared repositories, branching and merging, states of source files, and code reviews. Code reviews in a team environment are extremely important. This sets the tone for how the progam will be further developed and helps identify bugs and solve security issues. Code reviews are designed to help the team to create a plan and to assist in decision making processes. Code reviews should detail important in-line comments for each element of the projects strucutre which is also a best practice collaborative environments as well as individually. Code reviews also aid in the support of stakeholders by understanding and fulfuilling the needs of the stakeholders. Another best practice include commiting changes sooner rather than later. 

### COMMUNICATING TO STAKEHOLDERS

Communicating to stakeholders are critical in keeping up with the design ideas, time frames, and making sure the staff is going in the right direction with the project. Code reviews also same time and money. Daily meetings and communication with peers through email and phone are others ways in communicating to stakeholders. With constant contact with the stakeholders, this ensures the project specifications can be discussed in detail or for any last minutes changes made by the stakeholders can be handled as well. In an agile environment, the master is responsible for communicating to stakeholders by sprints, backlog requirements, user stories and communication devices and applications.
